# Nemeo MVP Event Model

This event model describes the PRD’s MVP happy path from account creation and SimpleFIN linking
through provider-neutral ingestion, categorization, transfer handling, tracking-budget setup,
pace reporting, household collaboration, and authorized MCP access. Post-MVP capabilities remain
outside the spine and are recorded in the PRD.
